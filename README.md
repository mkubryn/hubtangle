Hubtangle
=========

Hubtangle is an open platform that gathers people around common interests - called hubs.

Connecting people using their interests - not their friendships - gives completely different experience in terms of controling the content that people want to receive.


Why care?
---------
How much of the content you see on your Facebook/Google Plus account acctualy matters to you? Do you really care about your friend's cat or his complains about the weather? Why not to subscribe only those subjects which are important to you like a holiday trip or projects that he make.

What if we could subscribe a single aspect of someone - not his whole life - just things we care.. Here comes **Hubtangle**.
